		<br><br><br><p class="bl">I want to experience skydiving because it looks cool and I like to feel alive. 
		You feel something in your stomach every time you freefall, and that's what I love. I like extreme rides, such 
		as rollercoaster, drop tower, and more. It makes you scream of excitement and forget everything. That's the 
		kind of thrill that I want to experience from skydiving. I'll definitely try it in the future.</p>

		<br><br><br><p class="bl">Snow is beautiful. I want to see snow falling from the sky and feel the cold air. 
		I live in a tropical country, which is why there is no winter. I do not like the hot weather that we have. Maybe 
		that is the reason why I like to see and experience snow. I want to make some snowman and just act like a kid. 
		Make some snow angels and just enjoy the moment.</p>

		<br><br><br><p class="bl">CAPYBARA! I really want to see them in person. They look so calm and I am a calm person, 
		that is why I'm interested in capybara. They are the cutest animal in the world, after cats. Seeing them interact 
		with each other or other animals would be nice to see. I always watch some short clips and always see myself smiling 
		as I watch the videos about them. I hope I can see them soon.</p>

		<br><br><br><p class="bl">Being on water feels like freedom. Everytime I'm below the water, I always feel peace 
		the noise are gone and all you can hear is the water or bubbles. I used to attend swimming lessons from then, I 
		I liked being on pool, ocean or just bathtub. I never experienced scuba diving for some reason. I want to see the 
		beauty in the water. Fishes, corals, and everything (<i>just not the scary stuffs</i>).</p>

		<a class="imgs" href="Images/mountain.jpeg" target="new"><img class="bl" src="Images/mountain.jpeg"></a>
		<br><br><br><p class="bl">I like to be physically active, and mountaineering or simply mountain climbing is a 
		perfect activity that I want to try. Being part of nature feels great and climbing a mountain is good for our 
		mental and physical health. I saw a lot of pictures of my friends on a mountain, I'm kind of jealous. Just kidding.
		I really want to experience it though. Maybe soon with a friend.</p>
